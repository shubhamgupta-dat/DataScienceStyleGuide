## 1. Background

Python is the primary language being used, by Data Science Teams, to develop and deploy solutions. It is important for various developers to remain on the same page. This style guide is a list of _DOs_ and _DON'Ts_ for the team's developer. This can be referred by internal and other teams and suggestions are welcome. This style guide is inspired by the Google's style guide for python.
